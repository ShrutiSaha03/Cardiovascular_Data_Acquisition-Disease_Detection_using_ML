# Cardiovascular_Data_Acquisition&Disease_Detection_using_ML
ü´Ä AI-Augmented Heart Monitoring using PCG and ECG Signals This project focuses on non-invasive detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), especially Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), using Phonocardiogram (PCG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. It combines signal processing techniques with machine learning and deep learning models to analyze heart sounds and rhythms.  üîç Key Features:  Signal acquisition using digital stethoscopes and ECG sensors  Preprocessing: filtering, spike removal, and normalization  Segmentation of heart sounds using the Springer HSMM algorithm  Feature extraction from both time and frequency domains (PSD, LFCC)  Classification using SVM and CNN models  Noise cancellation using adaptive filtering (NLMS, Wiener)  üéØ Goal: Develop a low-cost, AI-based diagnostic aid for early detection of heart diseases using wearable sensors and MATLAB-based signal analysis.
